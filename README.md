**Week Four Challenge: Blog Site**

**This is a collaborative weekly challenge. You will be working with a partner to build out the site and submitting one GitHub repository.**

Create a blog site that contains multiple entries about topics we have covered so far in this bootcamp.

+ Each blog entry should have a date, title and content body.
+ The home page should display a list of the blog entries. However, the content for each entry is not shown entirely. The user should be able to click a "View Details" or "View More" link from each blog entry that will take them to another page that displays that entire blog entry.
+ There should be a profile page for the blog authors that includes their names, a short bio, profile photos, and links to their social media sites (LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Facebook, etc.). The social media links should also include icons representative of which social media platform.
+ Include a page that describes the bootcamp.
+ The blog site should have a navigation bar that's present on all pages.
+ Use Bootstrap and Google Fonts.
+ Make the site look nice and professional.
+ Given the following categories, create at least two blog entries per category:

1. GitHub
1. Program Design & Algorithms
1. Core Java
1. Object-oriented Java
1. HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
